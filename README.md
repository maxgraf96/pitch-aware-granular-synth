# Pitch-Aware Granular Synthesis for all!

This repository contains the source code for a pitch-aware granular synthesizer written in C++ for the Bela platform.
The project was done for the final project in Music and Audio Programming at C4DM, Queen Mary, University of London.

A video explaining and demonstrating the system is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/rtKI67ztNYo).
